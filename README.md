# Deploy-JavaScript-App-Using-Jenkins-On-AWS

I successfully deployed a JavaScript application on AWS using Jenkins to automate the CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins handles the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient integration and delivery with each code update. By leveraging AWS services like EC2 for hosting. This setup streamlines the development workflow by enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment, reducing manual intervention and speeding up delivery. The result is a high-performance, scalable JavaScript application with automated deployments that enhance reliability and availability.
